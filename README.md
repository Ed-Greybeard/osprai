Open Source Picture Review &amp; Analysis Investigator

A work in progress modular open source media categoriser and analysis tool, developed in Python, GTK, and Glade.

For those who wish to develop this project on Microsoft Windows, you will require the All-In-One PyGI/PyGObject Installer which can be obtained [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pygobjectwin32/files/)

Development on any of the exisiting modules may also require the OpenCV 2.x library.
